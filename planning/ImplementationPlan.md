# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Structure and Setup

1. Create project structure with Foundry
   - Initialize project with `forge init`
   - Set up dependencies (OpenZeppelin contracts)

2. Implement interfaces
   - Create `IVaultFactory.sol`
   - Create `IGoalPayVault.sol`

3. Implement mock USDC contract for testing
   - Create `MockUSDC.sol` with 6 decimals

## Phase 2: Core Contracts Implementation

1. Implement VaultFactory contract
   - Define data structures
   - Implement constructor and admin functions
   - Implement vault creation function
   - Implement invite code generation

2. Implement GoalPayVault contract
   - Define data structures
   - Implement constructor
   - Implement fund contribution logic
   - Implement member management

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Implement vault completion logic
   - Add deadline checking
   - Add target amount checking
   - Implement fund distribution

2. Implement invite code system
   - Generate and validate invite codes
   - Join vaults with invite codes

3. Implement vault discovery
   - Get vaults by creator
   - Get all active vaults

## Phase 4: Testing

1. Write unit tests for VaultFactory
   - Test vault creation
   - Test invite code generation
   - Test vault discovery

2. Write unit tests for GoalPayVault
   - Test fund contribution
   - Test member management
   - Test vault completion

3. Write integration tests
   - Test full workflow from creation to completion
   - Test invite code system

## Phase 5: Deployment

1. Create deployment scripts
   - Script for local development
   - Script for testnet deployment
   - Script for mainnet deployment

2. Document deployment process
   - Environment variables
   - Network configurations
   - Verification steps
